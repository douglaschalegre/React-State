## Quick Start

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, then start the app and mock API.

## Starter Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Added a mock API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Configured `npm start` to run the app and mock API at the same time using [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all).
1. Installed [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom), [history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) (React Router peer dependency), and [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cross-env) for declaring environment variables.
